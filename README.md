-Career counselling reflection 

One instance in which a reflection was required was when we were required to complete a group project for Project 3. The problem was that members weren't meeting their milestones on time, and the deadline for submitting the work was approaching.
I had to talk to the group leader in order to resolve the issue as a team member who overcame the situation to witness the team's triumph. We reached a consensus, which was later communicated to the members. As a result, the group ended up with better cooperation and the work was covered. 


-Skills and interests

Being well prepared is a learned skill that can offer intelligent questions that will stand out during interview.  
Another gained skill is the capability to show sincere interest in the position and conform to the companyâ€™s principles as one does research about the company.

-Personality assessment 

A situation where I had to increase on my strengths, was when I faced Adp3 project group. As we divided the work I realized I had to cover different topics in order to help the projects success.
